# React Native Rocket AWS Amplify Launch Pad

Welcome! This is a starter project for learning to use AWS Amplify with React Native. It's primarily geared towards being used with tutorials published by [React Native Rocket](https://medium.com/react-native-rocket).

The app isn't very useful unless it's paired with an AWS Amplify project. To learn how to get started with Amplify, check out [the official docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/).

If you just want to look around the app UI without creating an Amplify project, comment out the following line from `App.tsx`:

`Amplify.configure({...awsConfig});`
